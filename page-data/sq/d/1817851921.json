Return the key fob in the envelope you receive it in.” \n\nI scramble to type down her instructions in my notes app.\n\nShe rattles off a list of numbers that I can call: Axis Apartments Front Desk, Residential and Hospitality Services, Student Health Services, CAPS, and Penn Police, just in case. \n\nCheerfully: “Call me back at this number if you have any more questions.” The call ends.\n\nA few hours later, I lug my suitcase four blocks to Axis Apartments, pausing every few steps to catch my breath. It’s only ten days, but I packed a kettle, collapsible lamp, and comforter, recommendations from former isolators. Arriving at Axis, an Allied Security guard helps me carry my luggage up to the second floor landing—he tells me that COVID–19 patients aren’t allowed to use the elevators, because people actually live on the upper floors. I search for my key among the name–labeled red plastic bags crammed onto a small table on the landing: Sam…Paige…Eleanor…Sienna. Finally, I spot mine, Mira. Now starts ten days in isolation.\n\nOn Nov. 30, 2021, Penn’s COVID–19 Response Team sent an announcement to the University community about a campus–wide increase in the COVID–19 positivity rate. The following day, the Office of Student Affairs sent a message encouraging student organizations to postpone social events. According to Penn’s Fall 2021 COVID–19 dashboard, between Nov. 28 and Dec. 18, 2021, a total of 431 Penn students tested positive for COVID–19. On Dec. 18, 2021, a total of 414 students were in isolation, with 88% available capacity in Penn’s isolation spaces.\n\nBut during this time, students recall that Penn’s isolation buildings were exceeding capacity. We reached out to the Campus Health COVID–19 Management Team Lead Christopher Blake Felix DiDonato multiple times, as well as Senior Associate Director of Residential and Hospitality Services Courtney Dombroski, who redirected us to Penn Business Services Director of Communications and External Relations Barbara Lea–Kruger, who introduced us to Penn Wellness’s Mary Kate Coghlan, who was unable to get back to us with a response from Penn Wellness. SHS shared limited information about COVID testing and isolation policies, which was already available through Penn’s COVID FAQs. No one was able to speak with us about reports about the conditions in isolation dorms.\n\nAmid the uptick in COVID–19 cases on campus, students isolated in a number of buildings around University City, including dorm buildings, off–campus apartment buildings, and other locations owned by Penn. The experience was an added source of stress amid finals and the end of the fall 2021 semester—for many of these students, once they tested positive, they felt as if they became a second thought to the University.

It’s just one of the many confusing phone calls she’s had since testing positive for COVID–19.\n\nAfter performing with her dance group Onda Latina at Carnegie Hall on Dec. 10, Paola went to get a COVID–19 test the next day, Saturday, Dec. 11. Knowing she had just attended a high–risk event, she also decided to self–quarantine, sleeping separately from her roommate. By Monday, she still hadn’t received the results, so she went to get another test. She received a negative test on Monday afternoon and that evening, saw friends and slept in the same room as her roommate.\n\nBut the next morning, Tuesday, Dec. 14, Paola woke up to a red pass and a message that she had tested positive for COVID–19. Soon after, she received a call from the University telling her she would need to move to Axis, an isolation dorm. Paola explained to the University representative that she had never gotten her test results from Saturday but had tested negative the day before. \n\nPaola was told that it was likely that her test from Monday was a false negative, that her positive test from Saturday was unlikely to be an error, and that she would be isolated. They explained that the probability of a false negative with Penn’s saliva–based PCR tests was much more likely than the probability of getting a false positive. She felt nothing but confusion and anxiety for all the people she had exposed in the past day.\n\n“All I could think was ‘Why am I being told I’m positive four days after I got tested?’” says Paola. “It shocks me that the testing system at this school can mess up so badly.”\n\nPaola suspects that the delay in receiving her Saturday results was likely the result of timing—Penn’s COVID–19 testing labs are closed on Sundays. “It made me really angry that I could have gotten so many people sick.” Luckily, to her knowledge, no one she saw on Monday tested positive after seeing her. She was also the only person in her dance troupe that tested positive.\n\nBut the confusing communication from Penn only continued through Paola’s period in isolation. Any time she had a question and she called the phone number given to her upon moving to Axis, she would be transferred multiple times—it seemed that she could never find someone who could answer her questions, and different people would share conflicting information.\n\n“They kept asking me, ‘Who was it that you talked with?’ I thought they had a good record of things, but it seemed like it was always on me to refer them to the person who had previously told me certain information,” says Paola.\n\nAt one point, while on the phone with a representative from SHS, she was informed that the date that she was allowed to leave isolation had changed to Dec. 24—two days later than she had initially been told. Even though she didn’t go into isolation until the 14th, her ten–day isolation period should have begun the day she tested positive. However, when she called to confirm the date that she was leaving isolation, it seemed that the date had been misrecorded—she was now being told she couldn't leave until Christmas Eve.\n\n“For a second, I thought I wouldn’t be allowed to go home. That was my biggest fear—that I would miss Christmas,” says Paola. Eventually, she was able to confirm that she could leave on the 22nd and returned home to her family. \n\nPenn’s testing system seems pretty straightforward: Get COVID–19 tests regularly, quarantine if you’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive, if you test positive, get a Red Pass, move into one of Penn’s designated COVID–19 isolation dorms. But Paola’s experience demonstrates that the testing system isn’t as seamless as it’s made out to be.","items":null},{"headline":null,"subhead":null,"authors":null,"content":"Paola Camacho (C ’24) sits alone in her isolation room at Axis Apartments, on hold with a representative from Student Health Services.

I felt very paralyzed and cut off from the life I had just a week before. \n\nWe had a guard at the front, right by the door. They’re like the ones at all the dorms who make sure no one else gets in, but when we had to sign out every day, it really felt like they were there to make sure we didn’t get out (which is fair; we had COVID). We were able to go on walks out into the world, which were really nice. Get some fresh air. But it was December and the days were short, so there were often days when I’d see some blue sky and then get out and the sky would either be gray or dark - which doesn’t exactly help one feel happy. Anyways, those walks were a good way to reset my mind and I loved them. But at the end, you had to return to the Axis. And I remember this one walk where I just couldn’t bring myself to do it-to go back that is. I remember being out there feeling like life was meaningless and that the days made no sense and what am I doing. We were about halfway through our quarantine at this point and I felt fine physically, but mentally I think I was at my worst. It felt lonely seeing the same few people every day. My debit card had recently stopped working and the food sucked, so I couldn’t find the joy in food that I normally do when I feel this way.  And people still ask me, are you all recovered, and I am from the disease but from the mental aspects? Maybe. I really don’t know","person":"Sam Cheever, C'24"},{"text":"Luckily one of my finals was online anyway so I just took that as scheduled. The only in person exam I had was the week after isolation ended and was eventually moved online. I took the one in isolation from bed, which probably wasn’t ideal. I had a killer headache the whole time, couldn’t breathe all that well, and had to stop to cough frequently. I also suffered from brain fog as one of the symptoms so my ability to focus was definitely impacted for both studying and the exam. Additionally, I found it hard to get any work completed in the room just because I’m not the type of person that can work effectively where I sleep. It definitely didn’t help that I was only able to eat microwavable meals for the duration of my stay. I think the worst part was the day that I moved into isolation, I had to take a make-up midterm. Although I’d spent the past two weeks studying, I could not focus on any of the questions whatsoever, partially because I was incredibly sick, but also because the walls were so thin I could hear when someone coughed a couple doors down or was walking down the hall. I definitely would not consider isolation a place that’s all that conducive to studying or completing exams. I think when you’re sick you need to take care of yourself but just given the timing wasn’t really a possibility. I felt guilty for not being able to study to the best of my abilities, but I also couldn’t force myself to study in the physical and mental state that I was in, so it was just a never ending cycle of chastising myself and stressing myself out knowing that I wasn’t being productive. Being locked in a room alone for a week is bad enough as it is but then being forced to sit an exam on a wobbly desk with minimal lighting then never really being able to leave that environment after you finish the exam makes it so much worse. Not to mention that it’s hard enough to get in the mindset to take an exam in a room where you’re supposed to be taking care of yourself to get healthy.","person":"Paige Dendunnen, C'23"},{"text":"At first, it all felt very sudden because I still had some midterms in classes to take, so the thought of making them all up plus the finals I would miss was pretty stressful. But it ended up actually being really nice to have them pushed back and spaced out more than they would've been normally, so I think I actually ended up having more time to study for each of them rather than cramming like I normally do.\n\nBut also since I did end up having symptoms I also gave myself a few days of just laying in bed and watching Netflix, which was a nice mental health break among the normal stressful testing season.\n\nIt did feel a little weird to end the semester that way, missing the last day of classes and having people leave Penn already by the time I got out.","person":"Sienna Robinson, C'23"},{"text":"I got my covid test on tuesday around 3 pm and then tested positive the next morning around 10 am. I went into quarantine at axis (not Sansom) around 3 pm that day.\n\nThe hardest part was being completely alone. I got COVID for the first time in February 2021, but was in the COVID dorms with a lot of my friends. This past time [November 2021], I was in Axis while other Penn students were in Sansom place west. Therefore I did not know anyone in Axis and did not talk to another human in person for  a week, which was definitely hard.\n\nI was double vaxxed but I was not boosted. MY main symptoms were that I was exhausted. For my first couple days in the q I just slept all day. I also had a runny nose and sore throat.\n\nIt was hard because I got an extension on my schoolwork but that does not mean that all my schoolwork went on pause. Therefore as soon as I was feeling better I had to do double the work that I had done in the past. All the work for my extensions and all the work that I had due that week. I was in VP for probably multiple hours a day it was definitely a grind! This made it very difficult because although I was out of quarantine I still was not 100% and then had to do more work than I had done all semester.","person":"Sarah Katz, C'24"},{"text":"I felt pretty lost when I found out I was positive since it was the very beginning of finals. I was really hoping for emotional or academic support from Penn, but was disappointed. Besides getting an automated message each day asking how I was doing, it didn’t seem like the university cared enough to make sure students such as myself were okay (both mentally and physically). I was concerned about getting accommodations from professors, as well. I got pretty sick from COVID, and am still not fully recovered. Some of my professors were extremely understanding, but I did struggle to receive any sort of help from one of the departments, which left me feeling overwhelmed and isolated. I already struggle with mental health issues, and it felt as though that once again the university did not care.","person":"Eleanor Grauke, C'25"},{"text":"The most difficult part was missing school. I missed 3 final exams in isolation and now have three incompletes until I take them in the makeup period. The university almost put me on a mandatory leave of absence and I had to explain my situation to the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standing.","person":"Sophie Mwaisela, C'24"},{"text":"I was quite bored during isolation but I at least had people to facetime and I was able to do my job virtually to keep me occupied. I slept most of my Isolation not because I had symptoms because I did not but because I didn’t want to just be left with my own thoughts. This was the most frustrating part because I felt ok yet I wasn’t allowed to take any finals, and once one out of the two was placed online it was too late as I didn't study for it since I was told it was strictly in person. Other than that I fortunately was placed in a sorority house that had no guards so I was able to move to the kitchen and roam the house if I felt trapped in my room. I didn’t get to really see anyone after isolation because as soon as I got out I went home. The people that I did see dropped me off food and it was quite upsetting because they were either scared to get close to the building or you could only talk to them with a door in between. I have to say I think others had it worse than me, it really depended on where you were placed.","person":"Kayleigh Mooney, C'25"},{"text":"The hardest part was not knowing that if I dropped dead anyone would know. The support from Penn (besides the lovely telenurse Hilary who checked up on me a couple times) was so scarce and apathetic. It felt like the university didn’t care about me, they only cared about if I transmitted the virus to anyone. Which they didn’t even do a good job at controlling. For example, during my time at Sansom I had to leave my room everyday to get my food, putting the graduate students that lived there, the security guards, and the front desk workers at risk. I was so scared I would give it to anyone. That, along with the lack of support from Penn, made it one of the worst experiences of my life. Many things happened that week and a half that I definitely grew from. One of them being a better understanding of my place as a student at Penn.\n\nI had not gotten my booster at the time. I don’t know if that contributed to my symptoms or not, but I did not have a fun time physically. I experienced the host of typical omicron symptoms plus more (I don’t know for sure if I had that variant but I think I did). It was truly an odd experience; nothing like any sickness I’ve been through. I was up and down the whole time, and I still have bouts of weird flare ups. Kinda crazy, mostly scary.\n\nGetting covid during the reading period and finals was actually a little convenient. I only missed one class and one final. However, that one final was in-person the week they didn’t move them online so now I have to take it in late January. So, needless to say, I am still stressed and anxious over break. Also, the academic support from Penn was very delayed and of no help. Contacted me about 6 days into my 10 day isolation. It was an extremely isolating experience, I am thankful for everyone that made it even an ounce better.","person":"Trevor Arellano, C'24"}]}]}}]}}}
