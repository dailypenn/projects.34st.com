After all, the accomplishments of our featured stand–out seniors tend to speak for themselves. \n\nBut this year felt a little different. \n\nThe Class of 2021 has weathered what few of us could have predicted would come to pass when we were sent home that fateful March 2020 day: a fully online school year. \n\nThese Quakers spent their last lap around the track navigating Zoom meetings, time zone differences, and social distancing mandates. They lamented the loss of traditional milestones associated with flying the coop that now had the labels “virtual” or “limited in–person attendance” tacked onto them. \n\nYet, as the profiles that fill the pages of this year’s Penn 10 issue illustrate, even a pandemic couldn’t stop this year’s graduating class from leaving a legacy behind at dear old Penn. \n\nFrom spearheading student activism to working as contact tracers to running organic chemistry workshops, this year’s soon–to–be–graduates found unique ways to make their marks amid the chaos. \n\nAnd that, dear readers, deserves a mention.\n\nTomorrow, we’ll go back to picking up the pieces of a life uprooted by COVID–19. But today, we celebrate our kickass Class of 2021.","subheading":"Class of 2021, this one's for you.","author":"Hannah Lonser","img":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn-34s/60e8675f-fdaa-4943-a678-3ad35b6a9afd.sized-1000x1000.jpeg?"}],"penn_declassified":[{"link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CMur4Y1j0kQ/","subheading":"Calling all incoming first-years: Street's Penn 10 answered your burning questions about all things campus culture, including how to make friends, handle the hookup scene, and budget your dining dollars.","author":"Jesse Zhang"}],"profiles":[{"name":"Erin O'Malley","link":"https://www.34st.com/article/2021/05/erin-o-malley-poet-asian-american-studies-penn-10","subhead":"Things Erin loves: spoken word, Asian American Studies, '90s riot grrrl music, and resisting capitalism","img":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn-34s/434bdadb-9698-4c49-90f3-1e94dcfe7826.sized-1000x1000.jpg?"},{"name":"Bernie Wang","link":"https://www.34st.com/article/2021/05/penn-10-bernie-wang-viper-spec-band","subhead":"Bernie's passions for energy research, trombone, and tae kwon do followed him from grade school to Penn.","img":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn-34s/75df8117-6b32-47a6-81f6-7a7a62d5bde6.sized-1000x1000.jpg?"},{"name":"Sydney Lewis","link":"https://www.34st.com/article/2021/05/penn-10-sydney-lewis-hillel-contact-tracing-vaccine-clinic-volunteer","subhead":"The former Hillel president turned contact tracer talks the importance of defaulting to yes.","img":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn-34s/c63a5948-b433-4208-a7a8-c999c5ec275e.sized-1000x1000.jpg?"},{"name":"Faith Mamaradlo","link":"https://www.34st.com/article/2021/05/penn-10-faith-mamaradlo-philly-design-designers","subhead":"Meet the Penn senior who has devoted herself to decolonizing design and cultivating community in the process.
